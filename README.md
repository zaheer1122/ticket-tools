Our config documentation is moved to another file:
[click here to view](https://www.github.com/DJj123dj/open-ticket/wiki/config-v2.4.0)

### intents & permissions
In the discord developer portal in the "bot" panel you will find 3 switches under the title "Gateaway Intents". The following switches should always be turned on
- `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`
- `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`

To work the best, the bot needs `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions.
You can also configure your own permissions
